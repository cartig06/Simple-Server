While I'm still not sure how this could be useful to anyone, I figured I'd share this. It's just something i made to 
practice threading and basic networking, but who knows.

To use the 'Client' and 'Server' objects, just import the main script to something you'd like to apply it to.

The only arguments the init method for the server takes is a port you'd like the server to be hosted on.

For the client, you'll need to supply a host and a port. The host should just be the IP address of the computer the server 
is running on.

In the future, I'd like to mess with user authentication and maybe use the flask library to link a mysql database to it.
This is the only way i know how to link a DB to a python script, however if you know a better way feel free to let me know.
This would in turn, however, allow me to implement message logging and would probably just be more practical overall. 

Any feedback would be appreciated, thanks for viewing
